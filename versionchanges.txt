Reacted to changes to Checkstyle 6.0

AnExtensibleTreeWalker no longer reflects on Treewalker as that is not robust.
It is simply a copy of Treewalker with all code duplicated.


AnExtensibleTreeWalker no longer changes file date as new checkstyle no longer prevents unmodified files from being rechecked.
CachingTreewalker really not needed now.

DetailAST is no longer a class, it is an interface that removes some of the antlr methods: toStringTree() and toStringList()

Found a similar private method in an ASTStringTreePrinter printTree.
Created UNCStringTreePrinter that calls the method through reflection.
Also removes line numbers from printTree to implement printAbstractTree.

Some class names changed from Utility and Utils to Util.
Some method names changed from in??? to isIn???
one method name changes from filename to fileName.

Added to STType a method that gives fileContents() from which comments can be extracted.

Main class can no longer be copied to create non exiting main. It uses a different library which is not exported to an extension.
Added security manager to prevent exits from main to be honored.
No longer need to duplicate 1.8 checks

Added checstlye 8.3 jar and update site to: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B_HEzJVvzKTVaHdkRHZnQUpGOUk?usp=sharing

Recreated hermes plugin with checkstyle 8.3 and this project.
